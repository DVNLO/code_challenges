* simple vs non-simple : non-simple graph has multiple edges between nodes, and may also contain self loops.
* more terminology on the slide you should probably review
* weighted adjacency list is an interesting idea, I have not done that implementation. 
* reimplement dfs recursive and imperative;
* repeatedly said n and m for verticies and edges, just say v and e.
